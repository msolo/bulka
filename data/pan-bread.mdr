# Pan Bread

## Formula 500g
 - Bread Flour 100.00%
 - Water 63.00%
 - Salt 2.0%
 - Yeast 0.86%
 - Sugar 3.85%
 - Butter 7.69%
 - Dried Milk Solids 3.85%

## Notes

Sort of Pain de Mie.

* Sugar < 5% can go directly into the mix
* Butter > 5% should be held back and added at the end once the gluten is developed.

The dough should be proofed warm and humid (83F) and 80% relative humidity. This keeps a nice thin, soft crust.

Twist-in-the pan or side-by-side boules makes a nice shape.
